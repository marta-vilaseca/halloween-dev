# 🎃 Challenge #01 / 🧙‍♀️ Create the Perfect Potion

During Halloween night 🎃, a witch 🧙‍♀️ is preparing a magical brew. She has **a list of potions, each with an associated power**, and she wants to **combine two of them to achieve a specific total power**.

Given a list of integers where each number represents the power of a potion 🧪 and an integer representing the target power, **you must find the index of the first two potions that add up to exactly the target power**.

### For example:

```javascript
const potions = [4, 5, 6, 2];
const goal = 8;

createMagicPotion(potions, goal); // [2, 3]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If no combination is found, return `undefined`

```javascript
const potions = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const goal = 9;

createMagicPotion(potions, goal); // undefined
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In the case that there is more than one possible combination, **select the combination whose second potion appears first in the list**.

```javascript
const potions = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const goal = 5;

createMagicPotion(potions, goal); // [1, 2]
// it could also be [0, 3] but there is a combination earlier
```
