# 🎃 Challenge #04 / 🔺 Terror on Pyramid Head

You are trapped in Silent Hill, in a **square room of size n x n** and the feared **Pyramid Head (▲)** is somewhere in the room, **moving towards you (T)**.

**You cannot move, and Pyramid Head moves one cell per turn, in any of the four cardinal directions** (up, down, left, right), but **always chooses the shortest path to your position**. Your goal is to **determine if Pyramid Head can reach you**.

The room is represented by an n x n matrix:

- **T**: your position (where you are trapped).
- **▲**: the initial position of Pyramid Head.
- **.**: empty spaces where Pyramid Head can move.
- **#**: walls that Pyramid Head cannot pass through.

**Write a function to determine if Pyramid Head will be able to reach you.** If Pyramid Head can reach you, **return the number of steps** it takes to achieve this, **if it cannot reach you then return -1**.

```javascript
const room = [
  [".", ".", "#", ".", "▲"],
  ["#", ".", "#", ".", "#"],
  [".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
  ["#", "#", "#", ".", "#"],
  ["T", ".", ".", ".", "."],
];

escapePyramidHead(room); // -> 8
```

```javascript
const room2 = [
  ["T", ".", "#", "."],
  [".", ".", ".", "."],
  ["▲", ".", ".", "#"],
  [".", "#", "#", "#"],
];

escapePyramidHead(room2); // -> 2
```

```javascript
const room3 = [
  ["#", "#", "#"],
  ["▲", ".", "#"],
  [".", "#", "T"],
];

escapePyramidHead(room3); // -> null
```
